        log_level (int): The logging level that is used when invoking the :attr:`logger`.
        logger (logging.Logger): The logger object that is used to produce output. To support correct logging of any
            kind of output, the provided logger should use an empty terminator, i.e., ``logger.terminator = ""``.
            Furthermore, formatting is not supported.
        header_format (str): This is an optional format string that specifies a line header that is prepended to each
            line. ``start_format`` is supposed to specify a format for new-style formatting with `String.Formatter`
            (which is used whenever ``"some string".format(...)`` is invoked), and may use the named elements ``level``,
            for the logging level (as string), and ``timestamp``, for a current timestamp. A valid ``start_format``
            could look like this:
